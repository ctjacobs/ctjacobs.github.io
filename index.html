         <p><strong>Hello.</strong> I'm Christian Jacobs, a research scientist at the <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/">University of Southampton</a>.</p>
         
         <p>My research interests primarily reside in the field of <b><a href="research/cfd">computational fluid dynamics</a></b>, where I develop advanced numerical modelling techniques to better understand geophysical and aeronautical flow phenomena. I have made substantial contributions to <a href="http://www.fluidity-project.org/">Fluidity</a> (a computational fluid dynamics framework featuring adaptive unstructured mesh capabilities) with which I have simulated explosive volcanic eruptions and investigated the subsequent formation of ash plumes. More recently, I have worked on the European Commission-funded <a href="http://exaflow-project.eu/">ExaFLOW project</a> to tackle algorithmic challenges and develop techniques to enable exascale fluid dynamics simulations.</p>

         <p>I also have an interest in <b><a href="research/rdm">research data management</a></b>, particularly the issues surrounding reproducibility and data provenance in scientific computing. I have led the development of the <a href="http://pyrdm.readthedocs.org/">PyRDM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ctjacobs/git-rdm">Git-RDM</a> projects which assist researchers in publishing their software source code and data to online, persistent and citable repositories.</p>

         <p>For more information on my research, please visit the <a href="research">research page</a> and <a href="software.html">list of software projects</a>.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to research, I have a passion for <b><a href="teaching.html">teaching</a></b>. I regularly deliver computing and mathematics-based courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level. I am also a certified <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> Instructor, an Associate Fellow of the <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/">Higher Education Academy</a>, and a <a href="http://www.stemnet.org.uk/ambassadors/">STEMNET Ambassador</a>.
         
         <p>On the recreational side of things, I have a strong interest in amateur radio (also known as ham radio). I have been licensed since 2012 and currently hold the callsign M0UOS.</p>
