         <p><strong>Welcome.</strong> I'm Christian Jacobs, a computational scientist and lecturer with expertise in <b><a href="research/cfd">fluid dynamics</a></b> and <b><a href="research/rdm">data management</a></b>.</p>

         <p>A large part of my research involves the development of advanced numerical modelling techniques to better understand various flow phenomena. In particular, some of my most recent work has focussed on applications featuring significant amounts of turbulence, and the development of efficient algorithms for high-performance computing. Issues surrounding reproducibility and data provenance are also of particular interest.</p>

         <p>For more information on my research, please visit the <b><a href="research">research</a></b> page and list of <b><a href="software.html">software</a></b> projects.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to research, I have a passion for <b><a href="teaching.html">teaching</a></b> and have experience in delivering STEM courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.</p>

         <p>On the recreational side of things, I have a strong interest in amateur radio (also known as ham radio).</p>
