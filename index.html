         <p><strong>Welcome.</strong> I'm Christian Jacobs â€” a computational scientist and data professional. I have more than a decade of experience in algorithm design, mathematical modelling, software engineering, high-performance computing, data analysis, visualisation, and data governance. 

         <p>Much of my scientific research to date has involved the development of advanced numerical modelling techniques to better understand various <b><a href="research/cfd">fluid flow phenomena</a></b>. In particular, some of my most recent work has focussed on challenging applications featuring significant amounts of turbulence, and the development of efficient algorithms for high-performance computing. <b><a href="research/rdm">Data management</a></b>, reproducibility, data provenance and metrics are also of particular interest.</p>

         <p>For more information on some of my research, please visit the <b><a href="research">research</a></b> page and list of <b><a href="software.html">software</a></b> projects.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to scientific research, I have a passion for <b><a href="teaching.html">teaching</a></b> and have experience in delivering STEM courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.</p>

         <p>On the recreational side of things, I have a strong interest in amateur radio (also known as ham radio).</p>
