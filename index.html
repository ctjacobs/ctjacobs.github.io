         <p><strong>Welcome.</strong> I'm Christian Jacobs, a researcher with expertise in <b><a href="research/cfd">fluid dynamics</a></b> and <b><a href="research/rdm">data management</a></b>.</p>

         <p>A large part of my research involves the development of advanced numerical modelling techniques to better understand various flow phenomena. In particular, some of my most recent work has focussed on applications featuring significant amounts of turbulence, and the development of efficient algorithms for high-performance computing. Issues surrounding reproducibility and data provenance are also of particular interest.</p>

         <p>For more information on my research, please visit the <b><a href="research">research</a></b> page and list of <b><a href="software.html">software</a></b> projects.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to research, I have a passion for <b><a href="teaching.html">teaching</a></b> and have delivered several STEM courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.</p>
