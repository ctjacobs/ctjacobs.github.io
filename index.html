         <p><strong>Hello.</strong> I'm Christian Jacobs, a research scientist with expertise in <a href="research/cfd">fluid dynamics</a>, high-performance computing, and <a href="research/rdm">data management</a>.</p>

         <p>The development of advanced numerical modelling techniques to simulate and better understand various flow phenomena forms a large part of the research I undertake. For example, I have made substantial contributions to <a href="http://www.fluidity-project.org/">Fluidity</a> (a computational fluid dynamics framework featuring adaptive unstructured mesh capabilities) with which I have simulated explosive volcanic eruptions and investigated the subsequent formation of ash plumes. More recently, I have worked on the <a href="http://exaflow-project.eu/">ExaFLOW project</a> to tackle algorithmic challenges and develop techniques to enable exascale fluid dynamics simulations.</p>

         <p>The issues surrounding reproducibility and data provenance in the field of scientific computing are also of particular interest to me. I have led the development of the <a href="http://pyrdm.readthedocs.org/">PyRDM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ctjacobs/git-rdm">Git-RDM</a> projects which assist researchers in publishing their software's source code and simulation data to online, persistent and citable repositories.</p>

         <p>For more information on my research, please visit the <a href="research">research page</a> and <a href="software.html">list of software projects</a>.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to research, I have a passion for <b><a href="teaching.html">teaching</a></b>. I have delivered courses on computing and mathematics at undergraduate and postgraduate level. I am also a certified <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> Instructor and a <a href="http://www.stemnet.org.uk/ambassadors/">STEMNET Ambassador</a>.
         
         <p>On the recreational side of things, I have a strong interest in amateur radio (also known as ham radio) and currently hold the callsign M0UOS.</p>
