         <p><strong>Hello.</strong> I'm Christian Jacobs, a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/engineering/departments/earth-science/research/research-groups/amcg/">Applied Modelling and Computation Group</a> at <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>.</p>
         
         <p>My research interests primarily reside in the field of <b><a href="research/cfd.html">computational fluid dynamics</a></b>, where I develop advanced numerical modelling techniques to better understand fascinating geophysical flow phenomena. I am a core developer of <a href="http://www.fluidity-project.org/">Fluidity</a> (a computational fluid dynamics framework featuring adaptive unstructured mesh capabilities) which I use to simulate explosive volcanic eruptions and understand the subsequent formation of ash plumes.</p>

         <p>More recently I have developed an interest in <b><a href="research/rdm.html">research data management</a></b>, particularly the issues surrounding reproducibility and data provenance in scientific computing. I am the lead developer of the <a href="http://pyrdm.readthedocs.org/">PyRDM</a> project which assists researchers in publishing their software source code and data to online, persistent and citable repositories.</p>

         <p>For more information on my research, please visit the <a href="research">research page</a> and <a href="software.html">list of software projects</a>.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to research, I also have a passion for <b><a href="teaching">teaching</a></b>. I regularly deliver computing and mathematics-based courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level. I am also a certified <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a> Instructor, helping to teach basic computational skills to scientists, and an Associate Fellow of the <a href="https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/">Higher Education Academy</a>.
         
         <p>On the recreational side of things, I have a strong interest in amateur radio (also known as ham radio). I have been licensed since 2012 and currently hold the callsign 2E0ICL.</p>
