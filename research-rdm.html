      <p>I am the lead developer of <a href="https://github.com/pyrdm/pyrdm">PyRDM</a> (<b>R</b>esearch <b>D</b>ata <b>M</b>anagement with <b>Py</b>thon), a Python-based library which facilitates the automated publication of scientific software and data in online repositories such as those provided by <a href="http://www.figshare.com">Figshare</a>. The <a href="http://www.doi.org/">Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</a> that is minted for each repository enables a more formal way of citing research software and data (compared to, say, citing a generic user manual with no information about the specific revision of the software used to produce a particular data set).</p>

      <p>An overview of the typical actions that PyRDM performs is shown below for the case of software.</p>

      <p><a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> is first interrogated to obtain the revision of the source code currently in use. PyRDM then searches Figshare via its API to see whether that same revision of the code has already been published. If it has, the DOI can be reused; otherwise, the code is uploaded to a new repository on Figshare. PyRDM tags the new repository with the revision identifier (in the form of a SHA-1 Git commit hash), and adds author information obtained from the software's AUTHORS file, if present.</p>

      
      <p>A paper describing the PyRDM library has been published in the Journal of Open Research Software:
